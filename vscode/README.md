# Visual Studio Code

I have not yet automated the process of linking these settings, so for now, manually symlink them with:

```sh
ln -s $HOME/dotfiles/vscode/settings.json $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
ln -s $HOME/dotfiles/vscode/keybindings.json $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/keybindings.json
```
